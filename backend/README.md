# Server
Expected server capabilities include:
- OAuth for Github
- Retrieving user data (firestore?)

Much of the OAuth server functionality is credit to [TomDoesTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUE4-kSlPIk)

## Usage
// TODO: update this section and clean up directory structure
To run the server locally, cd into the backend directory and use any of the following commands:
